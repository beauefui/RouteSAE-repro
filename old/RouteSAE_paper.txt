Figure 3: RouteSAE employs a lightweight router to dynamically integrate activations from multiple residual stream
layers, effectively disentangling them into a shared feature space. It enables the model to capture features across
different layers — low-level features such as “units of weight” and “Olympics” from shallow layers, and high-level
features like “more [X] than [Y]” and “do everything [possible/in my power]” from deeper layers.

that it has two limitations: (1) Retaining only the

a large number of undiscernible features; (2) Each
feature is associated with only a single context,
reducing the reliability of the interpretation.
   To address these limitations, we introduce a new
approach for preserving feature contexts using an
activation threshold. For a given sequence context,

This approach allows the SAE to incorporate multi-

leveraging a richer feature representation compared
to hard routing.
   Discussion. Hard routing enforces sparsity by
selecting the activation from a single layer, typi-
cally the one with the strongest response for a given
input. This mechanism simplifies the routing task,
as the router only needs to identify the layer with
the highest activation. In contrast, soft routing ag-                     Figure 12: Pareto frontier of sparsity versus Norm MSE.

E.2     High-Level Features
 Feature 19: enumeration or distribution

 Explanation: The feature consistently activates tokens that are part of
a pattern involving enumeration or distribution, such as “each”, “neither”,
“all”, and “both”. These tokens are often used in contexts where items or
actions are being listed or compared, indicating a high-level feature related
to long-range pattern formation. The activations show a clear pattern with
no deviating examples, suggesting a strong monosemanticity.
Contexts: A caller, discussing how Clinton and Obama are both ter-

 Feature 1424: date expressions

 Explanation: The activations consistently highlight tokens that are part
of date expressions, specifically the day of the month in a date format (e.g.,
“January 1”, “February 28”, “March 31”). This indicates a clear pattern
of recognizing and activating on numerical day components within date
contexts, which aligns with high-level features associated with long-range
pattern formation, such as recognizing structured data formats like dates.
There are no deviating examples, hence the highest score for activation
consistency.
Contexts: As of January 1, more than one of every 100 adults is behind

 Explanation: The activations consistently highlight tokens that are part
 of comparative or equality expressions, such as “just as [adjective/adverb] as”
 and “equal [noun].” This indicates a clear pattern of identifying long-range
 patterns related to comparisons and equality, with no deviating examples.
